Intrigued by the name, I decided to see what they were all about.

Founded in 1933 (Trieste, Italy), Illy offers an espresso blend hand picked from nine different growing regions around the world. Illy sells medium or dark roasts, regular or decaffeinated, ground medium, fine or in whole bean form. They also sell their various of the coffee pod which they call â€” E.S.E. (Easy Serving Espresso) which I did not test.

For my review I obtained three cans of Illy coffee:

* Medium Roast, Fine Grind Espresso (Regular)
* Medium Roast, Fine Grind Espresso (Decaffeinated)
* Medium Roast, Espresso Beans (Whole)

One of the things I really like about Illy is the way they package their coffee. It comes in a metal can with a screw on metal cap. Unscrewing the top reveals a pop top with a warning that contents are under pressure. As you slowly pull up the tab the seal is broken and there is a hiss of air followed by the most amazingly fresh smell of coffee.

![Illy Cup](assets/images/illy_cup.jpg){: .pull-right}Coffee should be kept in a sealed, cool (not the refrigerator!), dry, and dark environment to retain its freshness for the longest possible period of time. The cans that Illy uses are perfect for this, the lids screw on tightly limiting the exposure to air. As an added bonus they can stack on top of each other.

I was curious to see what kind of espresso the medium roast beans would produce. Firing up the espresso maker I was impressed by the crema that it produced. Its hard to explain, but the espresso looked like a miniature Guinness being poured as the golden hue of the crema rose to the top. I did not find the espresso to be bitter or harsh, its very smooth without sacrificing complex tastes.

**Illy Fine Grind Espresso Coffee (Regular & Decaffeinated)**

The fine grind espresso coffee is suitable for use in espresso. French Press and automatic drip coffee makers. Those using it in an automatic drip coffee maker may find that the coffee is thicker than you are normally used to due to the fineness of the grind. If you find this to be a problem, consider using a finer mesh gold coffee filter.

**Burnt Taste & Bite Missing**

In testing the Illy coffee I included a number of different people in the testing process. After all, coffee is better enjoyed with friends! People immediately noticed the the Illy coffee lacks the burnt overcooked taste all too common in other coffees.

It lacks a harsh aftertaste which allows the coffee to finish strong without being overpowering. I really felt like I could enjoy and explore the complexity of tastes that the Illy blend of coffee brings to the table. I am very curious to try the Illy dark roast coffee and compare it to the medium roast.

And that is an important point to consider. If you try a coffee, and feel intrigued and excited to try the offer roasts or blends that they offer, the coffee is a success in my opinion. The great thing about coffee is that it is something we can all afford, I would encourage you to try Illy if you have the chance.

Illy coffee can be ordered online at the Illy Shop. We would like to thank Bratskeir & Company for the opportunity to review this coffee.
